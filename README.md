## Overview

### The project

this is a fully responsive Tic Tac Toe game with two game modes, win states, win indicators, and a cool theme.

This project was created as part of the Odin Project curriculum, an open-source web development education platform. The purpose of this project was to learn and practice new web development skills.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Grid
- Mobile-First Workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- encapsulate code using Module Design Pattern
- Factory Functions
- 2d Arrays
- I have improved my ability to decompose larger and more complex problems

I added some small code snippets below to illustrate my workwise

```javascript
const gameBoard = (() => {
  // some code...
  return {
    // some functions
    // some variables
  };
})();
```

```javascript
//factory function i used in the project
const player = (name, marker) => ({ name, marker });

let player1 = player("player1", "X");
let player2 = player("player2", "O");
```
